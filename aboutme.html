        <ul>
            <li> I was only 20 years old when I got married to a beautiful woman from Guatemala.</li>
            <li> I am actually from the United States. Born and raised there and left to live with <br/> 
                my wife since April 11th, 2022. </li>
            <li> I love to play instruments. My favorite instrument has to be the drums but currently, <br/>
                I haven't leanred them. I actually know how to play the guitar, bass, and a little bit <br/> 
                of piano. I want to fluently learn piano and then move to my next insturment <br/> 
                which is drums. </li>
            <li> I am part of my worship team at chruch and me and my wife are president and <br/> 
                vice president together. Though I'm the president, some times it feels like <br/> 
                my wife more suitted for president. </li>
            <li>WE LOVE TO TRAVEL!! We love going anywhere. Every year we go to Decameron, <br/> 
                El Salvador. We went there for our honey moon and haven't stopped going every year. </li>
            <li> I love to play sports though I don't watch a lot of Sports, I want to get more into it. <br/>
                 My favrotie sport has to be Football. (Yes it's soccer, but we have to say it the proper <br/> 
                 way.) I'm not saying I'm Messi but I love to be defender. </li>
            <li>My brithday is on November 6th, 2001. </li>
            <li>I love to play video games. It's my favorite activity outside of work and spending <br/> 
                time with my wife. I love playing shooters for the action and fast paced activities <br/> 
                or just relax playing some Minecraft with some lofi beats in the background while <br/> 
                I strip mine. </li>
        </ul>
